			 <p>First week of training down. Completed all the workouts, the yellow swim doesn&rsquo;t count. My training plan has the total time at the pool as the target duration while my watch only uploads total time swimming for swim workouts.</p>
<p>Still feeling extremely sore from the strength session on Wednesday. We hit legs, and we hit them hard. Luckily, it didn&rsquo;t have any impact on completing the work outs for the rest of the week.</p>
<p>In no way do I expect to have perfect weeks for the entirety of the 18 week build, but this is a great starting point to build off of up to IMTX in April!</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>
<p>Next week is going to be hellish. There is no way around it. Test week. Includes a 1000yd and 100yd swim time trial, two cycling power tests, some 5k time trials, and then another 10x100yd test swim. It won&rsquo;t be fun, but it&rsquo;ll set up my zones for the build and give me something to compare progress against.</p>
